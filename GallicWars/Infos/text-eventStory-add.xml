		<en-US>Word reaches Caesar in Narbo: the Helvetii, a powerful Gallic people hemmed in by mountains, the Rhine, and the Rhone, have burned their twelve towns and four hundred villages. Under arms and driving their families before them, 368,000 souls march westward seeking new lands in Roman Gaul. Caesar recalls that these same Helvetii once defeated consul Cassius Longinus and sent a Roman army under the yoke. Rome has a score to settle.</en-US>
